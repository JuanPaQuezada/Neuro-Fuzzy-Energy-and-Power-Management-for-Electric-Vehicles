# Neuro-Fuzzy-EV-Power-Management
Neuro-fuzzy (ANFIS) power management system for electric vehicles using simulated BMS data

This project focuses on the design and simulation of a **neuro-fuzzy decision system** for **power limitation in electric vehicles**, inspired by concepts commonly found in **Battery Management Systems (BMS)**.

The objective is to estimate and dynamically adjust a **State of Power (SOP) limit** based on battery condition and driving behavior, using a **Takagi–Sugeno neuro-fuzzy approach (ANFIS)**.
The system is developed as a **software-based prototype**, prioritizing **engineering reasoning, interpretability, and adaptability** over hardware-specific implementation.

## 2. Engineering Motivation

Battery systems in electric vehicles operate under conditions characterized by:

* Non-linear dynamics
* Measurement uncertainty
* Strong dependence on thermal and load profiles

Conventional threshold-based logic is simple and interpretable but lacks adaptability, while purely data-driven approaches often behave as black boxes.

This project explores a **hybrid solution**, where:

* Fuzzy logic encodes expert knowledge and safety constraints
* Neural learning mechanisms adapt system parameters to data-driven patterns

The result is a control-oriented decision layer that balances **robustness, transparency, and flexibility**.

## 3. System Overview

The system evaluates battery and driving conditions and outputs a power limitation factor intended to reduce thermal and electrical stress while maintaining acceptable vehicle performance.

## 4. Input Variables

| Variable              | Range     | Description                                                      |
| --------------------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| State of Charge (SoC) | 0–100 %   | Represents the available battery energy                          |
| System Temperature    | 20–120 °C | Emphasis on critical regions associated with battery degradation |
| Driving Style Index   | 0–1       | Normalized indicator of load dynamics and driving aggressiveness |

The **Driving Style Index** abstracts current fluctuations and dynamic load profiles into a single normalized variable suitable for learning-based systems.

## 5. Output Variable

| Variable                   | Range   | Description                                                         |
| -------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| State of Power Limit (SOP) | 0–100 % | Upper bound on the power that can be safely delivered by the system |

The SOP output is designed to be mapped to downstream controllers (e.g., torque or current limits) in a real implementation.

## 6. Methodology

The development is carried out in two stages:

### 6.1 Classical Fuzzy System (Mamdani)

* Manually defined membership functions
* Expert-inspired rule base
* Used as a baseline for interpretability and behavior analysis

### 6.2 Neuro-Fuzzy System (Takagi–Sugeno / ANFIS)

* Parameterized membership functions
* Learning of premise and consequent parameters from data
* Improved smoothness and adaptability compared to the baseline model

---

## 7. Validation Approach

Due to the absence of physical vehicle hardware, validation is performed through:

* Model-based data simulation
* Scenario-driven testing (normal, stressed, and critical conditions)
* Comparative evaluation between classical fuzzy control and neuro-fuzzy control

This approach reflects early-stage development practices commonly used before hardware integration.
